Food Link üåç

A platform to reduce food waste in India by connecting donors with NGOs and volunteers.
During weddings, events, and functions, huge amounts of food often go uneaten and end up being wasted. Food Link bridges this gap by allowing donors to share leftover food details, and NGOs/volunteers to claim and redistribute it to people in need.
